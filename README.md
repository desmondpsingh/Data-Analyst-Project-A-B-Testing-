# Analyze A/B Results

Data Analytics Project: Analyze A/B Results 

# Introduction
A/B tests are used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, while the experiment group sees the new version. A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other. 

# Project Details
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Project Specifications
## Code Quality 
- All code cells can be run without error.
- Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

## Statistical Analyses
- All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.
- For all numeric values, you should provide the correct results of the analysis.
- Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.
